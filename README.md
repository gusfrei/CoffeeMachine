Day 15 - Project part of the 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp 

This project creates a virtual coffee machine that has three options to choose from: a dictionary.

The user chooses one and inserts coins; the program will calculate if there are enough resources and money. 
There are additional functionalities such as printing reports and turning off the machine. 

This project demonstrates the concepts of while loops, checking dictionary keys, and appending dictionaries based on the user choice.
